# lt2326-a2-transformers

The code that I used is taken from the demo from the course LT2326 and each demo uses a tutorial which can be found here: [tutorial for demo1](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/image_classification), [tutorial for demo2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/token_classification).
My main focus was on demo2 and demo1 is for the bonus.
The models can be found on google drive: [models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lD_uJdif98lBtGP_tXmBPHLM5ZE_4ds-?usp=drive_link).
